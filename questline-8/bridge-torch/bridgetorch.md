People: A = 1 min, B = 2 min, C = 7 min, D = 10 min TOTAL= 17min
Torch always goes with whoever crosses.

A and B cross → takes 2 minutes. (Total = 2)

A returns with the torch → 1 minute. (Total = 3)

C and D cross together → 10 minutes. (Total = 13)

B returns with the torch → 2 minutes. (Total = 15)

A and B cross → 2 minutes. (Total = 17)

conclude:-
 two slowest (7 and 10) together makes their slow times counted only once (10)
 two fastest (1 and 2) to shuttle the torch back and forth so the expensive returns are small.
